We have to make contextual word vectors.
For this we'll use RNNS. These are recurrent
neural networks. They relu on sequential information
in which one information vector comes just after
the other vector and there is relation between sequential
relation between these vectors. It is said that they also
have a memory in form of weights and by the impact of the
the state modules which comprise the architecture.
Therefore they are ideal for text and speech analysis.
LSTM is a widely used lstm model.
Let us say that there is a feed forward
neural network represented by A. It gets the input
"xt" at time step t based on which it calculates "ht".
Like this way we input each word and try to calculate the
next word and based on the estimated word vector we
further calculate the loss function and gradually 
calculate the gradients. There can be many varities to
it. These can be : - 
1. one to one
2. one to many
3. many to one
4. many to many
5. manty to many
